Welcome to my website ! It is currently under construction but I plan to share my experiences, projects and more. 


About me
======
I'm a freshly graduated engineer, with a Master in Big data & High Performance Computing from [ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/en/), and a MSc. in Machine learning at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). I am strongly drawn towards research topics, and have had research experiences at research institutions such as Météo France, ONERA -The French Aerospace Lab-, and Georgia Tech's DREAM robotics lab.
