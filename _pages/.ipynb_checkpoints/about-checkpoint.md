Welcome to my website ! It is currently under construction but I plan to share my experiences, projects and more. Feel free to see some of the things I share in the portfolio page, or to download my CV.


About me
======
I'm a freshly graduated engineer, with a Master in Big data & High Performance Computing from [ENSEEIHT](https://www.enseeiht.fr/en/), and I am expected to obtain my MSc. in Machine learning at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) this december. I am strongly drawn towards research topics, and have had research experiences at research institutions such as Météo France, ONERA -The French Aerospace Lab-, and Georgia Tech's DREAM robotics lab. I also have corporate experience, most notably in the rapidly growing Parisian startup Adriver.

I am now looking for opportunities all around the world to continue my journey in computer science, research and research & development. I particularly enjoy challenging  research topics that are on the cutting edge of their domains, and topics that can make a difference in people's life, for instance in health, technological or environmental issues.
